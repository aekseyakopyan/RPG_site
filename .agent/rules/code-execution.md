# Code Execution Rules

## Terminal Commands
- Always run `npm install` after adding dependencies
- Use `npm run dev` for development
- Never run production builds without confirmation
- Ask before running destructive commands (rm, delete, etc.)

## Testing
- Test responsive design at: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Verify animations don't cause layout shifts
- Check color contrast for accessibility

## File Operations
- Backup before major refactoring
- Follow existing folder structure
- Never modify node_modules directly
